# Dummy Data Generator Experiment
This experiment mainly designed to create data simulation as MySQL DB Portfolio that requires more than thousands of data lines.
This is done by using Python that generates integer or double (decimal) formula, also Mimesis Plugin for data string with Jupyter Notebook support as Note Management
to run Python in structured and organized way, especially for different tables.  I hope it help programmers creating data simulation mainly for DB portfolio purposes, and
using it wisely without any misuse, and remember I'am not responsibe with any misuses!
